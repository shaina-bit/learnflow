# learnflow
Adaptive learning system that personalizes learning paths based on learner behavior.

1. Problem Statement - 
Many students struggle to follow structured learning paths, track their progress consistently, and manage multiple skill-based projects in one place. Most platforms offer static content and treat all learners the same, without adapting to individual pace, difficulty, or engagement.
LearnFlow aims to solve this by providing a centralized system where learners can create personalized learning roadmaps, track progress visually, and manage projects using milestone-based tracking — while continuously adapting the learning flow based on user behavior.

2. Vision-
LearnFlow is designed as an adaptive learning system that understands how a learner progresses rather than just what they complete.
The platform begins with rule-based intelligence and is intentionally structured to evolve into an ML-driven personalization system over time.

3.Planned Evolution - 
Phase 1: Rule-Based Adaptation

Difficulty adjustment based on attempts and completion time

Prerequisite recommendations when learners struggle

Structured milestone-based learning paths

Phase 2: Analytics & Insights

Learner progress and engagement analytics

Identification of weak areas and learning bottlenecks

Admin/mentor dashboards

Phase 3: ML-Powered Personalization (Future)

Personalized learning path prediction

Difficulty and content recommendation models

Learning outcome optimization

Current Status

Phase 1 — System design and full-stack implementation (MERN)
